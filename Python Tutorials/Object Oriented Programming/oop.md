## Object Oriented Programming
Is one of the most intimidating subjects for beginning programmers. 
But it's one of the most important topics to study because it takes something from the real world and recreates it in the computer world.

For more complex Artificial Intelligence algorithms, they will be very useful to imitate the behavior of a Real Neural Network on the computer helping us to create an Artificial Neural Network.
